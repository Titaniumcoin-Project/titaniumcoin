Advantages of Titaniumcoin

Inflation management:
The inflation rate is controlled by reducing the subsidy every 300,000 blocks. This provides flexibility in managing inflation over time.

Stability:
Reducing the subsidy and setting the block time to a reduced value promotes stability. A fixed subsidy reduction interval helps prevent sudden changes in the coin's economics.

Predictability:
Reducing the subsidy every 300,000 blocks provides predictability for miners and other network participants. Setting a fixed block time also promotes predictability.

Block generation speed:
Blocks are generated every 2 minutes, which provides a higher block generation rate and faster transaction turnover compared to longer intervals.
